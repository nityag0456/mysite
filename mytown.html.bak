          <h1>My Town: Westborough, MA</h1>
          <p> Westborough, Massachusetts was established in 1717, making the
            town 306 years old. Westborough has a lot of history, but I would
            rather talk about my favorite things to do in this town. </p>

            One of my favorite <b>restaurants</b> is <b>Sake Hana</b>, a town
            favorite. Serving delicious, authentic Japanese food, you're sure to
            leave replenished. The staff is friendly and are quick to respond to
            any changes. Be careful not to eat too much here, because it's very
            easy to do with their large portions. Enjoy! </p>

            One of my favorite <b>places to hang out</b> is the <b>Bay State
              Commons</b>. This plaza has many stores and restaurants including
            a <b>Panera Bread</b>, <b>Roche Brothers</b>, and <b>Boston
              Interiors</b>, making it somewhere you can get everything you
            need. However, this isn't what makes the Commons so great. The large
            green space is truly the highlight. Concerts, block parties, and
            town-wide movie nights are some of the things that occur here,
            creating a bonding experience for the town. </p>
